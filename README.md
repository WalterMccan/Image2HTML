# Image2HTML
Convert your image to HTML code pixel by pixel.

It's a simple script which can convert images (most common formats) into size optimized HTML code. The main objective of this script is to generate **EMAIL CLIENT** friendly HTML that will be displayed by pretty much every client. 

*There are limitations in terms of image dimensions as most email clients have limits as to how many columns it will display. Big Images are truncated or displayed incorrectly (might also load slower).*
